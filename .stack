creative self actualization
maybe a CLI (explode me)
Cover DELETE that would leave entites file empty
cover yes schema file but no ent entites dir
a lot of the names in state machine module are still EXPERIMENTAL
EDIT
"business schema" that has a primitive types section
base actions perhaps not needed for that one actions
codename WASD
tons of work to make C-lib for kiss-db
learn enough SDK to make WASD
python that you write processing a request & giving a response into a swift app
learn python extensions: a C extension lib for some minimal python you write
archive cruft
cleanup to try and use swift package manager
do EDIT's in documentation
graph viz for fragments and generate docs from current frags
migrate real doc fragments to eno
have full on eno
[#874.9] files marked as "LEGACY" should be seated or deleted
[#874.6] away this stowaway test and arch for data pipes format collection
[#874.5] scripts that used to be executable either move under proj/cli or etc
[#874.8] multiple scripts that generated markdown. change them to be the new way
[#874.7] non-CLI should not load CLI to use this
the script that was once called "stream" done or absorbed
destroy existng sync architecture to be some new way
pass-thru translation integrated into CLI for create collection (CSV to MD)
let's see if we can have no "schema row" at all. rather the sync-able script should have a --for-sync
